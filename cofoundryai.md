# Cofoundry AI

## Overview

Agentic AI workflows to help you develop a software product in record time. Kickstart development with agentic AI workflows that can handle everything from ideation to code-generation to deployment.

## Features

### Ideas Workspace

A collaborative, AI-augmented space to flesh out startup ideas.

#### Features

- Create new "Idea Spaces" (projects)
- Write and organize notes
- Real-time autosave
- AI prompts appear as you type (e.g. "What problem does this solve?")
- Manual "Ask Cofounder" button for custom queries
- Multi-user collaboration (invite others by email)

#### Agentic Insight Loop

- Auto-summarizes notes
- Suggests features or pain points
- Offers probing follow-up questions

### Smart Actions (Agentic Toolkit)

Launch your idea into reality with AI-driven commands.

- Generate a business proposal from notes
- Create a list of features and prioritize them
- Break features into dev tasks
- Estimate dev effort (t-shirt sizing or hours)
- One-click “Create GitHub Repo + Project + Issues”
- GitHub OAuth + API integration
- Sync task list with issues
- Bootstrap codebase (pick frontend + backend stack)
- Generates web-client, api, cms folders
- Uses Payload CMS, Vite+React, Koa

### Search + Memory (RAG-Enabled Retrieval)

Use Supabase for notes/tasks + vector search for context.

- Embedding all notes and tasks with Mixtral
- Semantic search on all content via query bar
- Contextual agent memory across sessions

### User Auth & Project Dashboard

Basic account and multi-project management.

- Sign up/login (email/password or GitHub)
- Create/view/edit/delete projects
- Invite collaborators per project
- See task progress, proposal, and notes from dashboard

### Agent Console (Prompt Playground)

Let users explore and prompt the agent directly.

- Freeform chat interface tied to current project
- Insert project context manually or pull from notes/tasks
- Choose agent mode (e.g. ideator, dev, strategist)

### Optional Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)

- Branch idea spaces (for pivots or A/B concepts)
- Custom stack picker (e.g. Next.js, Nest, Flask)
- Visual roadmap builder (like Notion/Linear hybrid)
- Autonomous agents that run step-by-step plans
