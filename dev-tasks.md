Agentic Workflow for Organizing Tasks: A Conceptual Overview
Imagine your personal organizer web app has a team of invisible, intelligent assistants (agents) working behind the scenes to keep your tasks in order.

The Goal: To automatically gather tasks from various sources, understand them, prioritize them intelligently, and suggest how you should tackle them, presenting a coherent, optimized "to-do" list.

Here's how the agentic workflow would look:

1. The "Task Ingestion" Agent

Purpose: To continuously listen for and collect new or updated tasks from all your connected sources.

Inputs:

Linear API: New issues created, existing issues updated (due dates, status changes).

Google Calendar API: Events marked as "tasks" or personal appointments.

User Manual Input: Tasks you directly type into the organizer.

Notes Processor (from your other idea): AI identifies potential tasks within your rich-text notes (e.g., "Follow up with John next week").

Email Parser (future): Identifies tasks mentioned in emails.

Action: When a new task is detected or an existing one changes, this agent pulls the raw information (title, description, due date, source, external ID) and passes it on.

Output: Raw, unstructured task data.

2. The "Task Understanding & Contextualization" Agent

Purpose: To make sense of the raw task data, extract key information, and add context that the AI can use.

Inputs: Raw task data from the Task Ingestion Agent.

Actions:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Reads the title and description.

Keyword Extraction: Identifies important keywords (e.g., "report," "client meeting," "deadline").

Entity Recognition: Recognizes people, dates, organizations mentioned.

Sentiment Analysis (Optional): If the task came from an email or note, it might gauge the urgency or tone.

Effort Estimation (AI): Based on the description and historical data of similar tasks, it might predict how long the task will take (e.g., "This looks like a 2-hour task").

Output: Structured task data with extracted insights and estimated attributes (e.g., potential effort, key terms).

3. The "Intelligent Prioritization" Agent

Purpose: To assign a dynamic, real-time priority score to each task, considering multiple factors.

Inputs: Structured task data with context from the Task Understanding Agent, and your current calendar/schedule.

Actions:

Due Date Analysis: Tasks with closer due dates get a higher base priority.

Effort vs. Impact: Combines the AI's estimated effort with user-defined or inferred importance (e.g., "Client-facing tasks" are high impact).

Source Weighting: Tasks from "Work" sources (Linear) might automatically get higher priority than purely "Personal" tasks, based on your settings.

Dependencies: If task A depends on task B, the priority of A might be adjusted if B is blocked or delayed.

User Habits (Learning): Over time, it learns which types of tasks you tend to prioritize or procrastinate on, and adjusts its suggestions.

Calendar Availability: If your calendar is packed, it might slightly de-prioritize less urgent tasks that require a long focus block.

Output: An updated task list with a calculated, dynamic priority score for each task.

4. The "Scheduling & Time Blocking" Agent (Optional but powerful)

Purpose: To suggest optimal times in your calendar to work on high-priority tasks.

Inputs: Prioritized tasks from the Prioritization Agent, and your real-time calendar availability.

Actions:

Gap Analysis: Finds available time slots in your calendar.

Block Suggestion: Proposes specific time blocks for specific high-priority tasks, considering the AI's estimated effort.

Batching: Suggests grouping similar tasks together (e.g., "respond to emails" block).

Conflict Resolution: Flags potential overlaps if you try to manually schedule conflicting tasks.

Output: Suggestions for calendar events (time blocks) to tackle your tasks.

5. The "User Interface & Recommendation" Agent

Purpose: To present the optimized task list and insights to you in a user-friendly way.

Inputs: The highly prioritized and potentially scheduled task list from the previous agents.

Actions:

Display: Presents your "Today's Focus," "Upcoming Week," or "Overall Backlog" views, sorted by the AI's calculated priority.

Highlight Insights: Shows you why a task is prioritized (e.g., "High priority: Due tomorrow, client-facing").

Actionable Suggestions: If the Scheduling Agent has suggestions, it might show a button like "Add to Calendar" for a suggested time block.

Feedback Loop: Allows you to easily change a task's priority, mark it complete, or tell the AI "This estimate was wrong," feeding data back into the system for future learning.

Output: A dynamic, intelligent task list displayed in the web app, and user feedback.
